* TrollDB

[[file:https://travis-ci.org/krisajenkins/TrollDB.svg]]

TrollDB is an in-memory JavaScript database which prioritises
performance over *everything*. It is blazingly fast. You *will not*
find a faster in-memory JavaScript Database, so stop looking. You've
arrived dude.

** Basic Usage

First require the trolldb script:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type="text/javascript" src="trolldb.js"></script>
#+END_SRC

*** Insert

You can insert any form of structured data you like:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
db.insert({"balance": 12345});
#+END_SRC

TrollDB will optimize this insert for performance.

*** Query

You can query for data with pattern matching.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
db.query({"balance": undefined});
#+END_SRC

TrollDB will optimize this query for performance.

*** Update

You can update data with pattern matching.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
db.update({"balance": undefined}, {"balance": 54321});
#+END_SRC

TrollDB will optimize this update for performance.

*** Delete

You can delete data with pattern matching.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
db.delete({"balance": undefined});
#+END_SRC

TrollDB will optimize this delete for performance.

** Advanced Usage

*** Clustering

TrollDB features powerful Clustering support that beats the CAP
theorum. To connect to a cluster:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
db.connectToCluster();
#+END_SRC

TrollDB will seek out and connect to other nodes on the network in a
way that is optimized for performance. Should a node go down, when it
comes back up it will be re-synced with the rest of the cluster in a
way that is optimized for performance.

*** SQL API

TrollDB can translate queries expressed in industry standard SQL to
perfectly optimal TrollDB queries *on the fly* The TrollDB translator
will parse SQL *faster than your legacy relational database*

Usage: express your SQL statement as a string

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
db.executeSQL('DROP table Students;');
#+END_SRC


** Bugs

Please report any bugs in the Github Issue tracker. Please note that
only bugs that affect performance will be considered bugs.

** Status

Production-ready, if performance is your only concern.
